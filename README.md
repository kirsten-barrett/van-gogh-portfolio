Artist Portfolio Website
========================


Description
------------

This is a passion project meant to act as a sample of my work. It is a homepage demo of an artist portfolio website for the late Vincent van Gogh. Because of the copyright status of his work, I was able to have fun creating in lieu of legal agreements.

This website was designed by myself and built with Visual Studio Code utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks or templates.
